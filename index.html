<p id= "about"> Frank Sinatra was born in 1915 and rose to become one of the most recognizable men in music and film. Influenced by Bing Crosby, he became attracted to big band music. Not only a singer, he was a noteworthy actor, appearing in classic films including "From Here to Eternity." Many songs which he became famous for, in fact, were covers that he had done, such as "The Way You Look Tonight" and "Luck Be A Lady." He died May 14, 1998.
